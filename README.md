# MyFitnessPlan_App_project

This was a project in INT311 class. In this project we created a prototype app which is intended for users who are new to the gym and want to learn more about workouts to stay fit. 

In the final report our group provided the scope, user types, user tasks, market comparasion and app rationale, social implications and metadata schema worksheet for our proposed app. 

Prototype pictures were provided.
